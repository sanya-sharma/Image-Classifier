# Image Classification
This repository gives you an idea of how to implement all the building blocks of a neural network and use these building blocks to build a neural network of any architecture you want. This repository helps in:

- Developing an intuition of the over all structure of a neural network.

- Writing functions (e.g. forward propagation, backward propagation, logistic loss, etc...) that would help you decompose your code and ease the process of building a neural network.

- Initialize/update parameters according to your desired structure.

After this , it uses everything you have learned to build a deep neural network that classifies **cat vs. non-cat images**. The algorithm given an accuracy of 80% on the test set of 4 layer neural network.
